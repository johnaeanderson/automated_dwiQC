<center>_as delinated by the Kimel TIGRlab DWI working group (2019)_ </center>

We tested on HCP, POND, and SPINS. Found high agreement between automated ratings on the basis of these thresholds, and human visual review, the latter including review of the same metrics, and a comprehensive visual review of DWI volume data.

 These thresholds were found to reliably predict a number of different visual QC ratings from different raters. The suggested thresholds were as follows:

Repo Contents

`code`
- `01.Rmd`. This script performs two tasks. First, it examines the correlations between the 6 QC metrics. The intent is to ensure that, on a global level, there are no unexpected associations between quality metrics.  Second, it performs PCA. The intent to to generate a 'quality regressor' that can be used in subsequent analyses, assuming the first one or two PCs capture a large proportion of variance. 
- `02.Rmd`. This script visualizes participant scores on the 6 QC metrics, and summarizes which participants should be excluded on the basis of the groups' established thresholds. 

`/data`
- `/input`  
--`eddy.csv`.  In lab datasets, this file can be found in `/archive`
--`mrtrix.txt`. This output should be generated by the user (it does not, at present, exist in the `/archive`. A script to do so can be found at [here currently private](https://github.com/navonacalarco/thesis-2.0/blob/master/scripts/02_mrtrix.sh).

- `/output`.   
--`.csv` is generated by `01_.Rmd`. It is a dataframe containing the 6 variables of interest, as well as the first two PC scores. 
-- `.txt`is generated by `02_.Rmd`. It contains participant IDs exceeding exclusion thresholds.

__Examples__. When knitted in RStudio, `01.Rmd` should generate a report similar to the one [here](https://rpubs.com/navona/SPINS_DWI_QCeddyMRTrix), and `02.Rmd` as [here](https://rpubs.com/navona/SPINS_DWI_QCautomated).
